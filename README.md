# Crypto_Currencies

## Project Overview

In this project, `Unsupervised machine learning` was used to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies and create a report of the traded cryptocurrencies which were classified in group according to their features. This type of classification analysis can be used by an invesetment bank to propose a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its clients. The analysis steps is as follows:

- Preprocess the database
- Reduce the data dimension using Principal Component Analysis
- Cluster cryptocurrencies using K-Means
- Visualize classification results with 2D and 3D scatter plots
